# Hospital-Database-Design
Designed and implemented a database for course GLIS 657 - Database Design and Development

# Overview

In a hospital, the inpatient system is usually the most complex. The administration department needs to register patients’ information, staff’s information, check in and out patients, know each patient’s test results, and provide bills to them. Nowadays, some hospitals still use a paper filing system, which may seem plausible when the number of the patients are relatively small. However, as the patient number grows larger, paper files may be destroyed or information may be recorded incorrectly due to human errors in a paper-oriented system. Also, some data may be repetitive and redundant. To better serve the patients, staff, as well as the administration department in a hospital, an online database is needed.

We would like to help the administration department of a hospital build a database to manage inpatient department’s personnel information, patients’ visiting and medical records, bill information, etc. The database contains 13 basic tables, with patients table being the center of the system. It helps the administrators to register patients’ personal information, staff (doctors and nurses)’s personal and work information, record regular tests for treatment, monitor room availability and medicine use, and provide bills information to them.

Besides, accountants can retrieve bill information from the database to do financial reconciliation, and warehouse keepers can find relative medicine records to help managing their inventory.

#### The project consists of:
* A statement of the purpose, objectives and end-users of the database
* An analysis of the problem context in terms of entities, fields, relationships and data types
* A normalized Entity-Relationship Diagram
* A usable, small-scale database with interface created in MS Access
* Input Forms to enter and modify data
* Reports to retrieve and review data from linked tables
